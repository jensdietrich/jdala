\section{Usage and Evaluation}

\subsection{Building and Using \jdala}

\jdala can be obtained from GitHub by cloning \url{https://github.com/jensdietrich/jdala/}.

\todo[]{briefly describe two stage build, use of agent}


\subsection{Evaluation}


The tool is designed to be a technology readiness level 4~\cite{mankins1995technology} and has not been fully evaluated against real world data. Evaluation against relevant  benchmarks like Jacontebe~\cite{lin2015jacontebe} is future work. This would require the manual annotation of benchmark code. 

There is however a comprehensive test suite.  

\todo[]{describe tests here}
