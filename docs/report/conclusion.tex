\section{Conclusion}

We have presented \jdala, a proof-of-concept implementation of the \dala capability model built atop the Java programming language.
The implementation demonstrates that novel programming language concepts can be retrofitted into existing mainstream languages, thereby promoting their broader adoption. The \jdala framework provides a platform for experimenting with capability-based security in the context of real-world applications."
