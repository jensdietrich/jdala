%Concurrent programming language design is even harder \cite{HoareHints}.
%
because concurrent programs do two or more things at the same
time. Even if one thread of execution is perfectly correct, another
thread can interfere with its behaviour corrupting data, triggering
deadlock, or crashing the whole system \cite{fonesca2010}.
%
%
The most important kind of interference between threads are
\textit{data races} --- when one thread writes to shared memory that
another thread is reading or writing. 
The problem with data races is
that values stored into memory, and the values returned by any reads,
may be essentially arbitrary, depending on the semantics of the
particular language, its implementation, and even the underlying CPU
and memory architecture.
%
This is exacerbated because concurrent programs are typically written in low-level languages
such as C, C$++$, BLISS-32, or Swift, which provide
few correctness guarantees, making it easy to write \textbf{wrong}
concurrent programs
\cite{CCppSCAM2014,LuSurvey2008}.

%% Suggestions that functional programming can solve all problems of
%% concurrent programming in the object-oriented mainstream have been
%% rebutted by pointing to a simple key problem: \textit{``assignment is
%%   faster than copying''} to paraphrase Doug Lea
%% \cite{AssignmentVSCopying}. In a world of mathematical abstractions,
%% we can (probably) ignore the physics and thermodynamics underlying our
%% programs: we can copy any amount of information any number of times on
%% any number of processors all for free, so we never need to mutate any
%% existing information, and we never have to face the problems of
%% synchronisation and inference between threads.
%% %
%% For the rest of us, our programs end up embodied in physical models
%% running on physical processors \cite{betabook}, where copying a
%% gigabyte of information unavoidably takes a million times as much work, uses
%% a million times more power, allocates a million times as much space,
%% and generates a million times more heat, than overwriting one
%% kilobyte. We cannot ignore the differences that leak out between our
%% logical, immutable maps, and their underlying implementation
%% territories of memory locations that store data and the threads that
%% animate them \cite{CopyExpensive}.

A range of programming techniques have been developed avoid these problems
\cite{lea98,concurrentHard}, aiming to provide \textit{safe
  concurrency} where data races are prevented either by the design  of the
programming language itself or its associated tools.  Unfortunately, while 
concurrent programming is hard, safe concurrent programming language
design turns out to be even harder \cite{RustBook,EncoreTS}. 
%


While full-scale proof systems \cite{JacobsEA05,chalice,jonesTOPLAS83,MPC-Staden15,concur2007,DenyGuarantee,dd}
can guarantee correctness for programs in almost any languages,
they are too specialised for developers to use in practice
\cite{fonesca2017,shriramFormal2019}.

Contemporary static programming languages such as
Rust\cite{RustBook}, Pony\cite{PonyTS},
Encore\cite{EncoreTS},
%Singularity\cite{Singularity},
%Deterministic Parallel Java\cite{DPJ},
%Safe C\verb+#+\cite{GordonPPBD12},
Obsidian\cite{aldrichObsidianStudy2020}, and
Verona \cite{Verona} 
have demonstrated the efficacy of \textit{static
  ownership}\cite{ClaPotNobOOPSLA98,NobPotVitECOOP98} %%% BoyLeeRinOOPSLA02,ClaPotNobOOPSLA98 
%and capability systems
to ensure
concurrent programs are safe: Rust in particular has been adopted by
Microsoft\cite{RustPopular,MSRust}. By keeping track of each object's
ownership, these languages can determine when an object may be used,
when it may be changed, and the effects those changes can have on the
rest of the program.
%
%
%% Concurrent programming languages face three problems:
%% %
%% \textbf{Correctness}: concurrent threads must only interact with each other
%% in well understood ways \cite{MPC-Staden15,concur2007,chalice}.
%% %
%% % interference between threads must be prevented.
%% %
%% \textbf{Simplicity}: programmers must be able to read, write, and understand
%% safe, efficient programs \cite{lea98,stefikConcur2020,godefroid2008}.
%% %
%% \textbf{Performance}: 
%% concurrent programs should run efficiently
%% (or else why not just write a non-current program\cite{TeslaRewrite,RustRewrite}).

% +++ Jens: culled to save space ! +++
%While much simpler than full-scale program proof systems, these static
%concurrent languages rely on complicated static (compile-time) rules and
%restrictions, with many different capability annotations and ownership
%parameterisations that programmers find hard to learn and use
%correctly \cite{LearnRust,VizRust,HardRust}: they support writing
%correct and efficient programs, but they are still hard to understand
%\cite{SafeRust,FightRust} for a number of
%reasons. First, their design must be conservative, banning not just
%all concurrent programs that are \textit{actually} unsafe, but a large
%number of data-race free programs as well.  To programmers, this
%manifests as a large number of \textit{false positive} errors or
%warnings about problems that will never arise in practice.  For
%example, Rust's version of ownership types\cite{RustBook} bans even
%such common idioms such as circular or doubly-linked lists.  Second,
%programmers typically have to annotate their programs to give the
%ownership and capability checkers the information they need --- so
%rather than declaring an input stream ``\verb+in+'', programmers need
%to write complex expressions such as ``\verb+in : &mut InStream<'a>+''
%(where ``\verb+&mut+'' indicates that ``\verb+in+'' is a mutable
%reference, ``\verb+InStream+'' indicates that ``\verb+in+'' refers to
%an input stream, and  ``\verb+<'a>+'' is a lifetime (aka ownership)
%parameter indicating the originating scope of the input stream.
%Finally, these ownership annotations are required throughout
%the program,  even if only a small part is actually concurrent, or is
%otherwise likely to cause critical errors --- in Rust, an inflight
%entertainment system would have to be engineered to the same level of
%quality as a critical flight control system, even though the risks and
%requirements for each system are very different.

%% Application programmers are increasingly moving towards
%% \textit{dynamic} languages such as Python, R, and Julia
%% \cite{dynamic}.  These languages make it easier to write sequential
%% code, but generally provide no more support for wiring concurrent
%% code than sequential systems programming languages (and are are much
%% less efficient).  The Julia documentation, for example, says that
%% \textit{`` You are entirely responsible for ensuring that your program
%%   is data-race free, and nothing promised here can be assumed if you
%%   do not observe that requirement. The observed results may be highly
%%   unintuitive ''}

On the other hand,
%meanwhile
\textit{dynamically} concurrent languages like
JavaScript\cite{JSVAts},
%Erlang\cite{Erlang},
E\cite{MillerPhD}, and
AmbientTalk\cite{AmbientTalk} support simple,
concurrency-safe programming by design, ruling out whole classes of
bugs.
Programmers don't need to annotate their code
(an input stream could be just declared as ``\verb+in+'')
making programs easier to read and write.
Unfortunately, these kinds of dynamic approaches achieve safety and simplicity
by sacrificing performance, in particular by banning efficient
communication between concurrent threads.

In contemporary industrial software development, a range of techniques
for dynamic race detection are used in practice across a range of
programming languages
\cite{hong2015survey}.  Go, for
example, which includes syntax and implementation support designed to
encourage the use of many lightweight threads, recommends the use
of a race detector~\cite{GoCACM2022}.
The issue with race detectors is that they detect (potential)
data races --- they don't explain why a particular data race
occurs.

% +++ Jens: culled to save space ! +++
%Dynamic checkers and visualisers have been developed for ownership
%systems, as research tools \cite{hill:2002:jvlc,MitchellECOOP2009} and
%dynamic ownership langauges \cite{dynamicOwn,dynamicAlias}. The last few
%years have seen an 
%increasing interest in visualisations for Rust \cite{RustBook}, as the only
%langauge with ownership (albeit static ownership in Rust's case) to
%achieve some level of widespread adoption.

% +++ Jens: culled to save space ! +++ // languages already mentioned earlier
%Alongside Rust, a range of other languages have atempted to
%incorporate ownership to deal with concurrency, including Pony
%\cite{Pony}, Verona \cite{VeronaMemory2023,VeronaConcur2023}, and a
%recent proposal for Swift \cite{gallifrey-pldi2022}. 

In many ways the approach closest to Dala is a concurrent proposal for Python, also based on
dynamic ownership checking to maintain an explicit relationship
between objects and the threads that can access them
\cite{pyrona2025}. This proposal, \textit{Lungfish}, organises objects
in regions based on their ownership. Lungfish supports equivalents of
Dala's immutable, isolated, and shared objects, along with a fourth
category, ``cowns'' (pronounced ``cones'') for objects guarded by a
lock.
